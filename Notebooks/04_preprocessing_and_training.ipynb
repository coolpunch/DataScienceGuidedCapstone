    "In preceding notebooks, performed preliminary assessments of data quality and refined the question to be answered. You found a small number of data values that gave clear choices about whether to replace values or drop a whole row. You determined that predicting the adult weekend ticket price was your primary aim. You threw away records with missing price data, but not before making the most of the other available data to look for any patterns between the states. You didn't see any and decided to treat all states equally; the state label didn't seem to be particularly useful.\n",

    "In this notebook you'll start to build machine learning models. Before even starting with learning a machine learning model, however, start by considering how useful the mean value is as a predictor. This is more than just a pedagogical device. You never want to go to stakeholders with a machine learning model only to have the CEO point out that it performs worse than just guessing the average! Your first model is a baseline performance comparitor for any subsequent model. You then build up the process of efficiently and robustly creating and assessing models against it. The development we lay out may be little slower than in the real world, but this step of the capstone is definitely more than just instructional. It is good practice to build up an understanding that the machine learning pipelines you build work as expected. You can validate steps with your own functions for checking expected equivalence between, say, pandas and sklearn implementations."

    "So far, you've treated ski resort data as a single entity. In machine learning, when you train your model on all of your data, you end up with no data set aside to evaluate model performance. You could keep making more and more complex models that fit the data better and better and not realise you were overfitting to that one set of samples. By partitioning the data into training and testing splits, without letting a model (or missing-value imputation) learn anything about the test split, you have a somewhat independent assessment of how your model might perform in the future. An often overlooked subtlety here is that people all too frequently use the test set to assess model performance _and then compare multiple models to pick the best_. This means their overall model selection process is  fitting to one specific data set, now the test split. You could keep going, trying to get better and better performance on that one data set, but that's  where cross-validation becomes especially useful. While training models, a test split is very useful as a final check on expected future performance."

    "These results suggest that vertical drop is your biggest positive feature. This makes intuitive sense and is consistent with what you saw during the EDA work. Also, you see the area covered by snow making equipment is a strong positive as well. People like guaranteed skiing! The skiable terrain area is negatively associated with ticket price! This seems odd. People will pay less for larger resorts? There could be all manner of reasons for this. It could be  an effect whereby larger resorts can host more visitors at any one time and so can charge less per ticket. As has been mentioned previously, the data are missing information about visitor numbers. Bear in mind,  the coefficient for skiable terrain is negative _for this model_. For example, if you kept the total number of chairs and fastQuads constant, but increased the skiable terrain extent, you might imagine the resort is worse off because the chairlift capacity is stretched thinner."

    "**Q: 1** Write a summary of the work in this notebook. Capture the fact that you gained a baseline idea of performance by simply taking the average price and how well that did. Then highlight that you built a linear model and the features that found. Comment on the estimate of its performance from cross-validation and whether its performance on the test split was consistent with this estimate. Also highlight that a random forest regressor was tried, what preprocessing steps were found to be best, and again what its estimated performance via cross-validation was and whether its performance on the test set was consistent with that. State which model you have decided to use going forwards and why. This summary should provide a quick overview for someone wanting to know quickly why the given model was chosen for the next part of the business problem to help guide important business decisions."

    "\n",
    "We are building a model to predict the price of the ticket during weekends.\n",
    "\n",
    "The first thing that was done with the cleaned data was to split the data into 2 sets of train and test sets with a 70, 30 percent respectively. we will train on the model on the train data and test it on test dataset. \n",
    "\n",
    "Name, state, Region columns are removed from the dataset as they are not needed for modelling.\n",
    "\n",
    "we made sure that all the independent variables( features ) are of numerical data type. as the regression models only support numerical data types.\n",
    "\n",
    " The first thing that was to check how well mean could be a predictor for our data. the mean of the training data is 63.81 (Adult weekend price).  This was performed using sklearn's dummy regressor. \n",
    "\n",
    "When the model is evaluated using the regression metrics such as R-squared the results were obvious. the R2 was around 0. which suggest there is no variation that can be explained by using mean as the predictor value. The same goes with other metrics such as mean absolute error or mean squared error.\n",
    "\n",
    "For the first initial model we imputed the missing values with median and mean in the train and test dataset. and scaled the data using sklearn's StandardScaler. then we used Linear Regression as the model to predict the price. what we found is **there is a definite significant improvement in the performance but the data also suggested that the model overfitted the data. This can be inferred from the fact that the regression metrics shows decrease in performance on the test dataset than on train dataset.**\n",
    "\n",
    "we also built pipelines to streamline the process of imputing the missing values, scaling and regressing. this is achieved by sklearn's make_pipeline class.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since from the earlier linear regression model we saw that the model is overfitting and to avoid this one of the good way is to not select all the features (independent variables) but only the best features. which will reduce the overfit problem that we are having right now.\n",
    "\n",
    "On the First go with default set of k features we see the performance relatively poor. but if we started increasing the value of k we see there is an increase in performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "We are also using sklearn cross_validate method to see how the model is performing under different sets of train and test splits. the split is performed on the actual train set not on the test set itself. we should not expose the model to the test dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "We are using hyperparameters tuning using GridSearchCV by searching for total number of features that can be selected for best performance. From the GridSearchCV we found out that selecting 8 features gave us the best performance for LinearRegression model.\n",
    "\n",
    "We also performed the same analysis using RandomForestRegressor. this time when defining the pipe we remove SelectKBest from  the pipe. the reason why we did this is that RandomForestRegressor already has a hyperparameter that does the job. Also if we observe carefully after model evaluation is done and GridSearchCV is used to select best possible hyper parameters we see, the results suggest we don't need standard scaler. this suggest that scaling does not affect Random Forest models.\n",
    "\n",
    "We also checked to see if the data is sufficient for modelling using learning curve. from the graph it there is more than enough data for modelling.\n",
    "\n",
    "So To conclude:\n",
    "\n",
    "we decided to select Random Forest Regressor as the best model for the next modelling steps as it has better performance compared to Linear Regression model in terms of lower cross validation mean absolute error. It also exhibits less variability which is evident by standard deviation of the CV Scores. The scoring method used here is mean absolute error which for this is the best metrics for model evaluation."
